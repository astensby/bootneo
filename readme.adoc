=== Starting point sample application for Spring Data Neo4j using Spring Boot and Spring Data REST

=== Installation

Make sure to have a Neo4j Server running, http://neo4j.com/download[download] and start with +bin/neo4j start+.

Run mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start and expose all Repositories as Spring Data REST repository-endpoints.
At runtime, Spring Data REST will create an implementation of this interface automatically.
Then it will use the @RepositoryRestResource annotation to direct Spring MVC to create RESTful endpoints at /people and /beer.

----

To access the Spring Data REST repository-endpoints try:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/people
curl http://localhost:8080/beer

=== Roadmap:
* Adding tests
* Examples of more advanced queries in Repositories
...


=== Sample Cyper Queries

----
MATCH (me:Person) RETURN me;
